I complete all this tasks by using the simple programming language
HTML, CSS and JS

This project consists of three dynamic web applications designed to manage study sessions, 
track expenses, and schedule appointments. Each tool is implemented using modern JavaScript 
concepts such as asynchronous programming, error handling, and DOM manipulation.

Here are the functionalities of all the problems :-
Problem 1: Online Appointment Scheduler
Objective: Manage and track appointments asynchronously.

Functionality
Add Appointment:
Allows users to add a new appointment with fields for client name, appointment time, and service type.
Ensures appointmentTime is a valid date and clientName is non-empty using try...catch.

Upcoming Appointments:
Displays appointments scheduled within the next hour.
Utilizes the Date and Math objects for filtering.

Send Reminder:
Logs a reminder message shortly before an appointment starts using setTimeout().

Problem 2: Expense Tracker
Objective: Provide a utility to track expenses with asynchronous reporting.

Functionality
Add Expense:
Adds a new expense with a description, amount, and date.
Validates input using try...catch (e.g., amount must be positive).

Total Expenses:
Calculates the total amount spent using the reduce() method.
Filter by Date Range:
Filters expenses within a user-specified date range.

Async Fetch Expense Report:
Simulates fetching an expense report asynchronously using Promises.
Logs the report upon successful resolution or handles errors when rejected.

Problem 3: Study Planner
Objective: Organize study sessions and track them effectively.

Functionality
Add Session:
Allows users to add a new study session with a topic, scheduled time, and duration.
Validates input using try...catch (e.g., duration must be a positive number).

List Todayâ€™s Sessions:
Displays sessions scheduled for the current day.
Utilizes the Date object for filtering.

Session Countdown:
Logs a countdown message when the session starts using setTimeout().
Async Fetch Study Materials:
Simulates fetching study materials asynchronously for a given topic using Promises.
Utilizes async/await for better readability and error handling.

So here are the features that I added to the problems using JS and make it look and feel good by adding HTML and CSS.
